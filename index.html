				About Me
				<hr><br>
				Hi! My name is Areya Behrouzian. I am currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in Political Science and minoring in Public Policy. In the future, I plan to attend law school.<br> 
				My goal in life is to dedicate my career to those less fortunate. There is nothing that brings me more joy than service. I have learned more about myself through service than anything I have learned in the classroom. The picture below was taken July 2011 in New Delhi, India. I was passing a photograph to a young man whose home was destroyed by the government without any notice the day before my visit. He was a victim of injustice, and his story inspires me to continue my studies.<br>
				One thing I discovered upon coming to Cal was a passion to explore fields outside of my own. I love to widen my knowledge and step out of my comfort zone. Thus far, I have taken courses in French, Computer Science, and Accounting. Next year, I plan to explore even more fields such as Economics, Statistics, and Persian Language.<br><br>
